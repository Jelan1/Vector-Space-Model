# Vector-Space-Model
This Project is an ongoing exploration of Vector Space Models. The first half will focus on statistical methods for vector comparisons. The second half will apply some Machine Learning algorithms on the processed data and extend the notion of VSM's to new domains. Live versions and published notebooks will eventually be available.

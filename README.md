# Vector Space Model
This project is an ongoing exploration of Vector Space Models. The first half will focus on statistical methods for vector comparisons. The second half will apply some Machine Learning algorithms on the processed data and extend the notion of VSM's to new domains. Published versions of each notebook as well as an accompanying repository wil eventually be available.

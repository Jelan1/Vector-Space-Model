# Vector Space Model
This project is an ongoing exploration of Vector Space Models. The first half will focus on statistical methods for vector comparisons in language and mostly comes from CS224U (https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/). The second half half extends the notion of VSM's to a new domain----Financial Markets. Published versions of each notebook as well as an accompanying repository will eventually be available.
